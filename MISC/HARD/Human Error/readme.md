A junior system administrator named Luther Stickell insists he didn't make any errors last night but i dont think thats the case cause our secret flag was never saved. all that i know is:
No files were hidden.
No encryption was used.
No binaries were involved.

All that remains is a snapshot of the user’s home directory.

Humans don’t notice what they leave behind — especially when fixing their own mistakes.
