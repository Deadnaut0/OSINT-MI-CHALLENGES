We tried to listen in.

A brief window opened — just enough to catch a call between Kairo and the others: Nyxx, Dusk, Ravel, Hexen.
The connection was stable. Too stable. No drops. No noise.

Yet nothing was understandable.

Their language wasn’t broken — it was complete, flowing perfectly between them while remaining unreadable to us. Their communication isn’t lost. It’s intact. Not meant for outsiders.

We also pulled a small locked archive from the same stream, but nothing links it to any known key.
This is all we managed to extract.

Can you make sense of it?
