WELCOME TO THE IMPOSSIBLE THRESHOLD

THE PH4N70M5, a covert operations cell, completed the high-risk mission IMPOSSIBLE THRESHOLD under full communications blackout. Officially, the operation succeeded—but immediately after, every member vanished without a trace. Last night, a single account linked to one operative flickered online, leaving behind the first clue of what happened after the mission. Your task is to follow the digital traces of that operative and uncover the hidden path of THE PH4N70M5 in the aftermath of IMPOSSIBLE THRESHOLD
