In 2017, during a quiet operation in Dubai, an IMF analyst noticed something off about a roadside billboard. The message wasn’t part of any campaign—it was a diversion, placed there by someone with insider access. Hidden in plain sight was a mobile number meant to be seen.

The anomaly was reported, and the display was taken down before it drew further attention. One detail remains: an old photograph captured near the site of the incident.

The coordinates mark the location of that moment:
25.23341370, 55.29182053

Your task is to identify the mobile device used to take the photo and the number shown on the billboard.
