Agent,

This footage was captured from a public animal livecam. No credits. No captions. No obvious markers.

Your first objective is to determine where this camera is located.

Once identified, trace the location’s connection to a moment that helped launch online video culture: the recording of one of the earliest and most iconic uploads in history.

Find the place and the person behind that first recording.

That is your flag.
