There is a figure I remember watching again and again when I was younger.

Not a person I knew, not someone I spoke to, just a presence that kept returning.

All that remains now is a broken line of words: 
"I’m the one they call when things go wrong ,and rock beats paper." ,or something close to that.

The last time I saw this line was in a post, more than five years ago. Since then, the trail has gone cold.

Somewhere, behind this fragment, a nickname still exists. Find it.
