My memory is failing me.

In 2018, I watched a Mission Impossible movie with someone I once knew well.

His name is gone, his face remains only in a single photograph.

I remember taking that photo at a real location used during the filming of the movie. Nothing else survived.

Your task is to trace that place and determine the exact date and time the photograph was taken, as well as the model of the phone used.
