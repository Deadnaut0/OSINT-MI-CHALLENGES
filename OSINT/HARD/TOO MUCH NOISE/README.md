Good evening, agent.

This audio was not recorded intentionally.

It was captured five years ago, in the background of a civilian video uploaded to YouTube. The person filming never noticed it — but the sound remained.

The file you received has been altered to hide its origin. Your first step is to restore it.

Once corrected, the sound should feel familiar: a public place in the COUNTRYSIDE

The audio itself is not the objective.

That is where the flag is.
