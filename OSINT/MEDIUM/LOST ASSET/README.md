Ethan, listen carefully. Your life depends on this.

The asset vanished on 2015-10-17, and the only trace he left is a seat on Delta flight DL7.
If we can’t reconstruct his movement, everything we’ve been fighting for collapses. No second chances.

I need you to dig up exactly what happened on that flight:

Where did DL7 depart from?

Where did it land?

And the aircraft itself — every detail that matters:
• Registration number
• ICAO identifier
• Manufacturer

Put those pieces together. They form the flag we need.
Move fast, Ethan. If you fail, we both burn.

flag format : OsintMI{deprat_land_registationNumber_ICAOid_manufacturer}

exact flag format : OsintMI{xxxxx_xxxxxxx_xxxxxx_xxxxxx_xxxxxx}
