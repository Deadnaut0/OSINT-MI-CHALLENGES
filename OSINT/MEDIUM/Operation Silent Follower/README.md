Ethan… we picked up a faint digital tremor—too precise to be random.
A hidden packet slipped through our filters, carrying one relic from the kidnapper’s trail:
a Discord User ID, scraped off a device they abandoned in haste.
Cross-checking reveals something unexpected—
this ghost quietly follows CyberTrace on Instagram, hiding in plain sight.
They think blending in with the crowd keeps them safe.
It doesn’t.

Your mission:
Track the Discord username behind that ID.
Identify the profile photo character.
Find the song they loop endlessly—and its writer.
