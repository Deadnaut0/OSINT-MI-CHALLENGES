Agent,

We have intercepted an IMF communication packet.
Inside it is a concealed directory linked directly to their internal database — unfinished, exposed, and vulnerable.

The secret you are hunting is not stored in plain data.
It is embedded within their best hacker — the one asset they trust to guard what matters most.

The system is newly deployed.
Their arrogance made them careless.

Access to the database requires no sophistication.
Use admin as the username.
Use admin as the password.

Enter silently.
Extract the truth.
Disappear before Ethan Hunt understands what was taken.

This message will not repeat.
