Oh no, it looks like Jim Phelps’s assistant pwned us!

Luckily, our experts managed to recover two key pieces of information:

• A file hash: 31a67bd8df37a9ea24232d13a18a51ffeac5472f
• A leaked message claiming that more intel can be found somewhere in a vault

Our team keeps digging, but we wouldn’t mind a bit of help.

Can you uncover what really happened?
